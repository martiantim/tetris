tetris
======

Plays a game of Tetris. All pieces are 2x2 blocks. The simulated player will place the piece at the leftmost
column that causes the least increase in the board height.

rspec tests/*_spec.rb to run the tests

ruby tetris.rb to run the game

NOTE: The board does not clear lines at present so board will fill up and the game will end
